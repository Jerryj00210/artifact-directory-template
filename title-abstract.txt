Title:
Face Mask Detection with Explainable Artificial Intelligence

Abstract:
<MY SUPER AWESOME PROJECT ABSTRACT>
This report addresses the concern of careless mask wearing due to the ongoing pandemic, which has caused small businesses and large businesses alike financial problem. As a result, we tackle this issue by building a face mask detector that will recognize whether a person is wearing a mask. More importantly, not only is our face mask detector able to detect whether a person has a mask on, it can also detect whether the person is wearing a mask correctly, or with both chin and nose covered. Our detector was trained on a dataset called MaskedFace-Net, which contains more than 35000 images, and was able to fit the training data while performing even better on the validation and test set. It is able to achieve 88% a 95% accuracy on training set and both validation set and test set, respectively.
